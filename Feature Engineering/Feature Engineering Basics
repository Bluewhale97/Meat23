# 1. Feature Engineering Basics

# using domain knowledge of the data to create features or variables to use in ML
# pivotal: fundamental to make algos work, key to improve ML model performance and time consuming

# 2. Variable types

# variable - numeric could be either discrete or continuous
# variable - categorical could be either nominal, ordinal or date/time

# 3. General process of feature engineering
# missing data
# categorical var encoding
# linear model assumtions: to fulfill assumptions
# distribution: normal, skewed or others
# outliers: unusual and unexpected values
# feature mangnitude: scaling
